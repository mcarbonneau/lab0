        <p id="intro"> Hello! My name is Madeleine (or Maddy). I am a senior studying Applied Math
          and <br> Biological Sciences. In my free time, I like to sing, run, and listen to music. <br>
          Over the summer I realized I really wanted to become better at software engineering and <br>
          development, so CS100 is a great opportunity for me!<br>
